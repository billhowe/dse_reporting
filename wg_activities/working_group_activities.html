<h1> Not-Worst Practices for DSE Working Groups (DRAFT)</h1>

<a href="https://github.com/billhowe/dse_reporting/blob/master/wg_activities">source</a> |

<h2>Purpose</h2>
This document is an initial attempt to capture successful patterns of working group "operations" as reported in the three institutions' annual reports and the six shared working group reports submitted in December 2015.   This material was motivated by a discussion on the bi-weekly leadership call on February 2/16. In that call, we noted that although the six working groups across the three institutions did not necessarily need to follow a uniform format, frequency, or participation level for meetings and activities, some working groups would be interested in adopting some standard practices from other working groups' experience.  Rather than have all working group leads commit to synthesizing material from all nine documents, a suggestion was to extract and assemble some relevant findings in a single place to spur a discussion.


<h2>Approach</h2>
We reviewed the nine documents and extracted a list of activities
, grouping them (subjectively, but we believe non-controversially) into seven categories.

Here are the results:
<div id="chart_div" style="width:800px; height: 450px"></div>

The seven categories are:
<ul>
<li> <b>Recurring working group meetings</b> for coordination, community-building, informal talks, and paper reviews</li>
<li> <b>One-time topic-specific meetings and workshops</b> e.g., Berkeley's data structures workshop</li>
<li> <b>Consulting/Support/Collaboration activities</b> e.g., incubator and office hours programs</li>
<li> <b>Administrative initiatives</b> that focus on influencing university policies and curricula</li>
<li> <b>Digital artifacts</b> including both software and web materials</li>
<li> <b>Courses and seminar series</b> that feature recurring, structured lectures</li>
<li> <b>External engagements</b> including projects with journal editors or collaborations with industry</li>
</ul>


For each activity, we indicate the institution (UCB, UW, or NYU) and working group (SWG, Repro, Spaces, ETWG, Careers, EEWG) that led the activity and a very short one-line description of the activity itself.  These activities are grouped and described according to the materials in the annual reports; in those cases where the activity was described as a joint activity with no obvious lead, multiple working groups and/or institutions are mentioned.  

The list is not necessarily exhaustive. Some activities appeared to be described as "sub-activities" and are not included (for example, individual talks in a seminar series).  Research projects were also not included, since the goal of this document is to try and extract best practices for administration and organization of the working groups.

Based on this clustering and informed by the other material in the annual reports, we make some observations and attempt to synthesize a set of best practices.

<h2>Summary of Activities by Category</h2>


The manually extracted list of activities is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YG1jLoPydawyFBDPLyMv0ZLDpUlhfZZlyUv57HAylic/edit?usp=sharing">available online</a>.  The activities are also include in this document in the next section.

Below are the counts of activities organized by category and broken out by working group.  (If you want to create additional charts, see this <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/Lbt5dufc/1/">jsfiddle</a> and note the SQL in line 6).  Clicking on a colored bar will sort by that working group, and hovering will show the specific numbers of activities. 


Some immediate observations that may inform best practices:

<ul>
<li>One-time topic-specific workshops are the most common activity, with activities logged in the reports by all working groups (except EEWG, which has led an extensive research effort in observing and analyzing the <emph>other</emph> workshops.)</li>
<li>Most working groups are involved in most categories, demonstrating our experience that working groups enjoy a considerable (and, we feel, beneficial) overlap in methods and objectives.</li>
<li>All working groups have established regular meetings of some form.</li>
<li>Although the SWG works extensively in producing and contributing to software projects (contributions that are somewhat de-emphasized by being categorized as digital artifacts along with web materials, etc.), the SWG makes considerable contributions in consulting and support activities, suggesting a shift in our collective emphasis toward "teaching to fish."</li>
<li>The Careers working group has put significant emphasis on administrative activities, reflecting their goals of influencing institutional practices and protocols.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Not-Worst Practices for Recurring Meetings</h2>
We've made some other observations based on the annual reports, with emphasis on how regular meetings are conducted:
<ul>
<li><emph>Cadence:</emph> Some conventions are emerging in the cadence of regular meetings.  The frequency is typically one meeting per week or one meeting per month, with those groups who meet more frequently typically having additional motivations for doing so (for example, the SWG at UW is also a forum for a weekly staff meeting of eScience-funded data scientists and research scientists.)  Some groups have changed practices to adopt this cadence.  For example, the UW Repro group previously held separate seminar and working group meetings, but recently combined the two into one slot with alternating content.</li>
<li><emph>Format:</emph> The content of recurring meetings depends on the goals of the working group, but variety appears to be desirable.  For example, the SWG meeting at UW uses four types of meeting formats: code reviews for invited guests, deep dive tutorials, guest lectures, and paper discussions. The schedule is posted online, and the members of the group select a slot to lead and have the freedom to select a topic that they wish. We have heard from groups that varied content helps keep the meeting fresh and helps avoid covering the same ground.</li>
<li><emph>Participation:</emph> Most meetings are open to all, and this openness appears desirable and beneficial in most cases.  We have heard in some cases that a meeting with non-zero turnover can sometimes lead to repetition of the same topics: at each meeting, new attendees need to be "caught up" and wish to explore some previously covered topics. However, this cost can be mitigated by recording discussions and making them available, and by having focused agendas with specific topics. </li>
<li><emph>Goals:</emph> Some working groups emphasize specific ongoing goals coordinated across multiple meetings: For example, the UW Education working group uses the regular meeting to design the new curriculum at the undergraduate and PhD levels and to discuss administrative strategy and progress in coordinating a campus-wide curriculum shift involving over six departments.  The UW Reproducibility group used the meeting to pursue the badges effort, which led to an online home for the project and a significant initial thrust.</li>
</ul>
