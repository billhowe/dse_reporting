# Not-Worst Practices for DSE Working Groups (DRAFT)

Bill Howe
March 6, 2016

## Purpose

This document is an initial attempt to capture successful patterns of working group “operations” as reported in the three institutions’ annual reports and the six shared working group reports submitted in December 2015.   This material was motivated by a discussion on the bi-weekly leadership call on February 2/16 in which we noted that although the six working groups across the three institutions did not necessarily need to follow a uniform format, frequency, or participation level for meetings and activities, some working groups would be interested in adopting some standard practices from other working groups’ experience.  Rather than have all working group leads commit to synthesizing material from all nine documents, a suggestion was to extract and assemble some relevant findings in a single place to spur a discussion.

## Approach

We reviewed the nine documents and extracted a list of activities, grouping them (subjectively, but we believe non-controversially) into seven categories:

* Recurring working group meetings
* One-time topic-specific meetings and workshops 
* Consulting/Support/Collaboration activities
* Administrative initiatives
* Digital artifacts (including software)
* Courses and seminar series
* External engagements

For each activity, we indicate the institution (UCB, UW, or NYU) and working group (SWG, Repro, Spaces, ETWG, Careers, EEWG) that led the activity and a very short one-line description of the activity itself.  These activities are grouped and described according to the materials in the annual reports; in those cases where the activity was described as a joint activity with no obvious lead, multiple working groups and/or institutions are mentioned.  

The list is not necessarily exhaustive. Some activities appeared to be described as “sub-activities” and are not included (for example, individual talks in a seminar series).  Research projects were also not included, since the goal of this document is to try and extract best practices for administration and organization of the working groups.

Based on this clustering and informed by the other material in the annual reports, we make some observations and attempt to synthesize a set of best practices.
